I'm a developer and a part-time ninja from Bogot√° who enjoys learning, coding, reading,
enumerations, sarcasm, and the Oxford comma. I'm very interested in algorithms, competitive
programming (I've got bragging rights for competing in the 2011 [ICPC World Finals](http://icpc.baylor.edu/welcome.icpc)),
continuous delivery, software architecture and data science.
