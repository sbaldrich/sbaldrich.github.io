Today I was talking with a couple of friends at work about some colombian code ninjas that are working on very interesting projects around the world and I've decided to step up my game; this is
why I am taking a *300 problem challenge* to help me regain some skills I lost since I stopped competing.

The conditions for the challenge are the following:

* All solutions should be added to my competitive programming [repo](http://github.com/sbaldrich/cp) and a quick summary should be [posted](http://sbaldrich.github.io/cp/).
* <del>The time limit is ~100 days (until the end of 2015 on [AoE](http://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe))</del> No limit, just do it.
* There should be no more than 200 easy problems (*levels A,B on Codeforces, 250 - 500 div2 on Topcoder, etc*) and there must be at least 50 hard problems (*Codeforces D or Topcoder 500+ div1*).
* Any programming language is allowed.
* I should take part in as many programming competitions as possible.

The odds are against me since this is not the first time I try to do something like this. However, I hope that the shame of not delivering after writing this post motivates me to try and do it.

### FAQ
* Why 300? Why not 500 or 1000?
  * I have to work and study other subjects. I have to step up my **whole** game, not just *cp*.
* Why 100 days? were you waiting for today to start the challenge?
  * Nope, coincidence.
* Do you really think you can do it?
  * heh.
