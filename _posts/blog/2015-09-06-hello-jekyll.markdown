Finally and after a lot of false starts, I've created my personal site using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.io). I've read a lot of good reviews about it; the idea of not having to depend on databases for a simple blog, the ability to use markdown for writing posts and the fact that everything can be hosted for free on Github made Jekyll a very attractive alternative for me.

So far I've found that not knowing any Ruby or Node might pose an obstacle in the future, but for now I am pretty satisfied with the result obtained from shamelessly copying, I mean, forking and adapting Michael Rose's [So Simple](http://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme) theme.
